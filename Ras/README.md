# RAS

This folder includes the scripts and some of the files used for the analysis of Ras using SVD.

### Accessing datafiles


To access the datafiles referenced in the paper regarding each of the clusters without running the 
code or webscrapper, access the following:
* RAS_clusters/RAS_4_*color*.txt ➡️ the sequences for each cluster (4) color in FASTA format
* RAS_clusters/RAS_4_*color*.csv ➡️ the information scraped from Uniprot for each cluster (4) color 


### Running the Jupyter Notebook

Running the jupyter notebook allows you to run all of the code as well as generate graphs, movies
and images that describe the data presented. To generate the graphs with the same style and format
as intended, download the **svd.mplstyle.txt** file. 
* **RAS_SVD_w_Figures.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook with figures + supplmental figures from the paper. It contains further functional analysis.
* **RAS_SVD.ipynb** is an abbreviated Jupyter Notebook that has figures we believe are most important for understanding the SVD analysis of RAS.
